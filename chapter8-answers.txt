-An error message 'This field is required' appears and does not let us create a category without a name.
What happens when you try to add a category that already exists?:
-An error message 'Category with this Name already exists.' appears and does not let us creat a category.
What happens when you visit a category that does not exist?:

How could you gracefully handle when a user visits a category that does not exist?:
